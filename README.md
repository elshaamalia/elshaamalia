### 🐾 Who I Am
On the surface, I appear calm, but internally, I'm usually debugging code (or life). I enjoy building things slowly in silence, and believe it or not, **I'm actually really good at prompting 💅.** Essentially, I'm surviving on caffeine, silent breakdowns, and the fine art of pretending everything is okay.

<br>

### 💻 Els's Thoughts
My entire belief system relies heavily on `Ctrl + Z`. I function best when the temperature is low, even if my commit messages are just a guilty "update." Current status: eternally tired, emotionally buffering, but somehow still coding.

### 🧁 What I'm Working On
- Small fun apps
- AI experiments
- Portfolio upgrades
