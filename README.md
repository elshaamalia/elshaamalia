<p align=""><i>Soft chaos inside, emotionally buffering, still coding somehow.</i></p>

On the surface, I appear calm, but internally, I'm usually debugging code (or life). I enjoy building things slowly in silence, and believe it or not, I'm actually really good at prompting 💅. Essentially, I'm surviving on caffeine, silent breakdowns, and the fine art of pretending everything is okay.

My entire belief system relies heavily on `Ctrl + Z`. I function best when the temperature is low, even if my commit messages are just a guilty "update". Current status: I’m still trying everything, even though it’s exhausting.
