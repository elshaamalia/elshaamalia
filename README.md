## 💻 Els's Thoughts
- Ctrl + Z is basically my belief system  
- Commit message: “update” (don’t judge me)  
- Productivity depends on temperature (usually low)  
- Life update: still tired, still coding  

## ✨ What I'm Currently Doing
- Looking for offering  
- Making progress only when I’m not supposed to  
- Pretending to understand my own architecture
