## Who I Am?
- Calm outside, debugging inside
- Good at pretending everything is fine  
- Building things slowly but very surely  
- Loves silence, clean UI, and code that doesn't fight back  
- Survives on caffeine and silent breakdowns 

## 🐾 Programmer Thoughts
- - **Ctrl + Z** is basically my belief system     
- Commit message: “update” (don’t judge me)  
- Productivity depends on temperature, usually low
- Life update: still tired, still coding 

## ✨ What I'm Currently Doing
- Looking for offering 
- Making progress only when I’m not supposed to be working   
- Pretending to understand my own architecture

## 🧁 What I'm Working On
- Small fun apps  
- AI experiments  
- Portfolio upgrades
